# BoardGameGeek (BGG) Integration

This application integrates with the BoardGameGeek XML API2 to enrich game data with high-quality images, descriptions, ratings, and more.

## Features

### üéÆ What Data is Fetched from BGG

- **Images**: High-quality game box art (thumbnail and full-size)
- **Descriptions**: Detailed game descriptions
- **Ratings**: BGG community average ratings (0-10 scale)
- **Rankings**: Overall BGG board game rank
- **Complexity**: Weight/complexity score (1-5 scale)
- **Game Stats**: Player counts, play times, recommended ages

### üöÄ How to Use

#### Option 1: Batch Enrichment (Recommended)

1. Go to the **Browse Games** tab
2. You'll see the **BGG Data Enrichment Panel** at the top
3. Click one of the batch buttons:
   - **Enrich 10 Games** - Quick test (takes ~30 seconds)
   - **Enrich 20 Games** - Good balance (~1 minute)
   - **Enrich 50 Games** - Comprehensive (~2.5 minutes)
4. Wait for the process to complete
5. Page will auto-refresh to show updated images and data

#### Option 2: Individual Game Enrichment

1. Browse your game collection
2. Find games without images (showing "No Image" placeholder)
3. Click the **"Get BGG Info"** button on any game card
4. Data will be fetched and displayed immediately

### üìä BGG Enrichment Panel

The panel shows:
- **Enriched**: Number of games successfully enriched
- **Errors**: Games that couldn't be found on BGG
- **Cached**: Total games with BGG data in memory
- **Total Games**: Your complete collection size

### üîÑ Caching

- BGG data is cached in server memory during the session
- Prevents duplicate API calls for the same game
- Cache persists until server restart
- Click **"Clear Cache"** to reset and re-fetch data

### ‚ö° Rate Limiting

The integration respects BGG's API rate limits:
- **300ms delay** between each game request
- **Automatic retry** on failed requests
- **Error handling** for unavailable games

2. **`app/api/games/enrich/route.ts`**
   - Single game enrichment endpoint

3. **`app/api/games/batch-enrich/route.ts`**
   - Batch processing with caching
   - Progress tracking

4. **`components/games/BGGEnrichmentPanel.tsx`**
   - UI for batch enrichment
   - Progress display
   - Cache management

5. **`components/games/GameCard.tsx`**
   - Enhanced to show BGG data
   - Individual "Get BGG Info" button
   - Rank badges

6. **`types/game.ts`**
   - Added `Game` interface
   - BGG enrichment fields

### üîç Troubleshooting

**Games not found on BGG:**
- Some games may have different names on BGG
- Expansions might not match standalone entries
- Very new or obscure games may not be in BGG database

**Slow enrichment:**
- Each game takes ~300ms to fetch (BGG rate limiting)
- 20 games = ~1 minute
- This is normal and prevents API blocking

**Images not loading:**
- BGG images are served from `cf.geekdo-images.com`
- Check browser console for CORS or network errors
- Some games might not have images on BGG

**Cache issues:**
- Click "Clear Cache" and try again
- Restart dev server to reset server-side cache

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- BGG API is free but has rate limits
- Don't spam requests (use batch processing responsibly)
- Cache is in-memory and resets on server restart
- Future enhancement: Persistent storage (database/file system)

### üöß Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Persistent cache (database or local storage)
- [ ] Background job for automatic enrichment
- [ ] Manual game name matching for mismatches
- [ ] Image fallback chain (BGG ‚Üí CSV ‚Üí placeholder)
- [ ] Export enriched collection to CSV
- [ ] BGG user collection import
